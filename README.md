This project contains the solutions to the ad-hoc business requests from the management team of Atliq Hardware. The goal was to use SQL to extract critical insights from the company's database to support data-driven decision-making. The project involved answering 8 business questions that required skills in data retrieval, filtering, joining, grouping, subqueries, and window functions.


NOTE: The core logic and initial code in this project are my own.I utilized an AI assistant purely as a tool for validation, debugging, and to explore alternative best practices to ensure the final queries were both accurate and efficient.
